# Markdown Pages for Slim Framework

This is a demo app that uses Slim Framework and Markdown (with front matter) to generate a page structure and push it into a template system. Presently, it uses smarty templates.


### TODO / Notes to myself

* Finish work on telling individual templates what their siblings, parents, and children are
* Use better method than exec/find to glob files
